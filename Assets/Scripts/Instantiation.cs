//Instantiates the interactables and the players
//This script needs to be put onto any object, preferably a common spawn point object
//
//To use: Drag the player onto the player prefab into its respective locations in the editor
//Drag the spawn points for the players and the spectators into their respective locations in the editor
//
//Note (Important): Ensure that both spawn points and spectator spawn points are within a parent prefab (as in, the actual spawnpoint locations are subsets of a spawnpoints prefab)
//This is to allow for multiple players to spawn in different locations
//For implementation, it is better to have it this way anyways, because this helps with being able to distinguish where the players should be spawning in
//Refer to the Template scene and look at the "PUN Spawns" in the heiarchy to see this script in use
